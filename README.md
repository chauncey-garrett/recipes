# The simplest plain text recipe format you can find!

# Project goals

The idea behind this project is create a recipe format (for cooking real food) that is extensible, convertable, and easy enough for non-technical users to (without trouble or worry) use and distrbute among friends and family. The format must be readable as is but must also be able to be used in a database and transfered to another format (say, LaTeX or HTML). Ideally (and eventually), a suite of conversion tools could be made once the standard recipe format is stable.

Of course, the standard format will be open source for future accessibility. My greatest aggravation in managing my home recipe collection has been that there are a number of programs available that are capable but none that can promise a future-proof format (that I know of at least).

## Initial proposal

Keeping in mind that these developers should be able to extend upon a standard format (and from what I know), YAML markup appears to be the best choice for this application (please let me know if you have better ideas!).

I've added a sample file. My initial thoughts are that:

- Recipes should be kept to one per file
- The ingredients should be seperated from their cooresponding amounts
- Preperation should be formatted stepwise

Let me know if you have better ideas!
